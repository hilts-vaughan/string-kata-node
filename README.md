# string-kata-node

A solution to the String Kata in Node.js with TDD Mocha tests to back it up. You can read more about that here: http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/

The solution is implemented inside of Node to get me familar with using Mocha and the TDD process inside of a Node application. The entire exercise was completed in about ~35 minutes (all 9 quesitons) so some of the code is a bit sloppy but it shows fundamentals.

There's a template here but no sample solutions: https://github.com/ymartin/kata-node-string-calculator

So, I am providing one. :)
